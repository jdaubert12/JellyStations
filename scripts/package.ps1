After each place's current conditions the channel now shows a loop of the last three quarters of an hour of precipitation radar over a map of the area, with nearby towns, a light-to-heavy legend and the frame clock. NOAA NEXRAD (through the Iowa Environmental Mesonet's time-enabled WMS) covers places in the contiguous United States; RainViewer covers the rest of the world. Frames are fetched every five minutes while the station is on, only the new ones each time, and cached under data/JellyStations/weather/radar. The map (coasts, lakes, borders, towns) is Natural Earth data packed into the plugin and drawn in the theme's colours, with four map areas to choose from (metro, state, regional, wide). The editor's forecast status shows the radar source and frame count per place, Fetch now refreshes radar too, and Preview screen can show the radar screen. Existing weather stations get the radar screen; untick Show the local radar screen to go back."
